### Design Principles

##### Encapsulate what varies
-	Identify the aspects of your application that vary and seperate them from what stays the same.

##### Program to an Interface, Not an Implementation
-	Clients remain unaware of the specific types of objects they use, as long as the objects adhere to the interfaces that clients expect.	

##### Loose Coupling
-	Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact
-	We say objects are loosely coupled when they interact with each other(coupled), but they don't know a 		lot about each other(loosely Coupled)
	
##### The Open-Closed Principle
-	Classes should be open for extension(of behavior) but closed for modification.

##### Single Responsibility
- 	A class should have only one reason to change
