### Object oriented Programming
-	Procedural programming follows a sequence of steps like cooking recipe
-  OOPs major advantage is code reusability 

##### Object
- 	Every object is self contained
-	Objects has its own identity, separate from other objects. Its own attributes to describe its current state 	and own behaviors - the things it can do
-	All objects have Identity(shiva's coffee mug), Attributes(color,size,fullness), and Behavior(fill(), empty(), clean())
-	Object is an instance of class
-	creating objects = instantiation

##### Class
-	Code-template for creating program objects
-	Class Components
	-	Name(Type) = What is it?
	-	Attributes(properties,data) = What describes it?
	-	Behavior(operations) = What can it do?	
-	Method = A program procedure that can return a value.
	-	Defined as part of class
	-	can only access data that is known to that object
