## Java8


#### Interfaces vs Abstract Method
- Interfaces cannot have state while abstract classes can have state
	-	Interfaces cannot have fields(private int value;) in them, compiler will throw erro
- We can extend only one abstract class but can implement many interfaces
- Interfaces are more preferable than abstract classes
